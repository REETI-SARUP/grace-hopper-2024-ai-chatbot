# AI Chatbot Masterclass: Building LLM-Powered RAG Chatbots with LangChain & Knowledge Graphs
Welcome to the Grace Hopper workshop!

Are you curious about the buzz around Generative AI and do not know how to get involved?
This one hour workshop is your step towards that direction where you will learn basic concepts of GenAI, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), Large Language Models (LLMs), Knowledge Graphs, LangChain, Prompt Engineering, and more. All these concepts will be covered using a real-world use case with sample dataset and code modules.
At the end of the workshop, you will have a working AI-powered chatbot, which will understand your questions and answer them. This chatbot can be easily extended to any other use cases. You'll walk away with practical GenAI knowledge, hands-on experience, and the confidence to apply these skills to future projects.
